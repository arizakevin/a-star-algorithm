The A* Algorithm implemented for path finding, made with JavaScript and p5.js. 

### Wikipedia 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
A* (pronounced "A-star") is a graph traversal and path search algorithm, which is often used in many fields of computer science due to its completeness, optimality, and optimal efficiency.[1] One major practical drawback is its {\displaystyle O(b^{d})}O(b^d) space complexity, as it stores all generated nodes in memory. Thus, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance,[2] as well as memory-bounded approaches; however, A* is still the best solution in many cases
